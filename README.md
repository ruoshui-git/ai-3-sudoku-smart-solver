# AI Smart Sudoku Solver

## Running Instructions

Rust code is in  `/rust`.

This repo doesn't have a working shim since submission to HW test server isn't required.

Use `cargo run --release` to see some results.

This "smart" solver isn't really smart right now. It just fills all the naked singles (once) before solving recursively.
